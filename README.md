If there's anything that the Minetest modding community seems to love,
it's explosives.  More explosions, more destruction, better efficiency
and better performance.

This mod is the culmination of all explosive mods.  It adds a nuclear
device to the game that's powerful enough to destroy the entire world,
and kill all players instantly.  Intense radiation renders the world
completely and permanently uninhabitable.  Terrain destruction is done
extremely efficiently via the Anthropic Principle.

### To construct the doomsday device:

**In MTG**: Surround a torch on all 6 faces with blocks of mese.
Surround those on all faces with blocks of diamond.

**In NodeCore**: Surround a lit torch on all 6 faces with lux
cobble.  Surround those on all faces with blocks of solid lode.

The device explodes the instant that its construction is completed.
The explosion is quite spectacular, and unlike anything you have ever
seen.  Unfortunately, it instantly kills you, so thoroughly that you
can't even witness the explosion.  You will just have to take my word
for it.

N.B. it doesn't matter what order you place the nodes, but they need
to be placed manually by a player.
